# Data Cleaning Using Python🧹  

This project focuses on cleaning, preprocessing, and preparing **two real-world datasets** using **Python in Jupyter Notebook**.  
The goal is to ensure high-quality, structured data that is ready for analysis or modeling.



##  Project Overview

Raw datasets often contain missing values, duplicates, incorrect data types, and inconsistent formats.  
In this project, I performed **end-to-end data cleaning** on two different datasets to improve data quality and reliability.

The project demonstrates:
- Practical Python data cleaning techniques
- Handling real-world data issues
- Writing clean, reproducible preprocessing code



##  Datasets Used

### 1️⃣ Medical Appointment Dataset
- Domain: Healthcare
- Focus: Patient appointment records
- Common issues addressed:
  - Missing values
  - Incorrect data types
  - Duplicate records
  - Inconsistent column formats

### 2️⃣ UCI Credit Card Dataset
- Domain: Finance
- Focus: Credit card customer data
- Common issues addressed:
  - Null and inconsistent values
  - Column renaming and standardization
  - Data type correction
  - Outlier and data consistency checks



##  Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Libraries Used**
  - Pandas
  - NumPy



##  Data Cleaning Steps Performed

Across both datasets, the following cleaning steps were applied:

- Loaded raw datasets into Pandas DataFrames
- Checked dataset shape, columns, and data types
- Identified and handled missing values
- Removed or validated duplicate records
- Corrected incorrect data types
- Standardized column names
- Ensured data consistency and integrity
- Performed basic validation checks after cleaning
